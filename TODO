Things I should get around to doing someday:

- Add user authentication to uwsgi version.

- Add search to uwsgi version.

- Fix bug that renders line breaks properly in javascript but not django (or get
  rid of use of django for messages in appengine version).

- Port AppEngine version off of depricated Channel API to either websockets or
  Firebase.

- Create an authorized users table, and some way of either restricting the chat
  to only class members, or to block spammers.
  
- Create admin interface for adding authorized users.

- When displaying source code, display in monospace font for better formatting.

- When displaying a URL, turn it into a link.

- Make it obvious which messages are new since you last looked at the chat
  window.

- Update title bar of window to reflect how much unread content there is.

- Display timezone-aware times, not just times in the server's time zone.

- Allow a user to filter out topics they don't care to converse about.

- Allow a user to click on a message and zoom in on just that topic, to make it
  easier to follow a thread of conversation.

- Allow users to post on a special topic named "ephemeral".  Such messages will
  not be stored on the server -- they will just be broadcast to whoever has the
  UI open and receiving messages right now.

- Figure out why after a while the connection from server to client goes down
  and doesn't come back until you reload the page.

- Possible idea:  provide ability to send private messages between users.
